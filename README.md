# RoboPi

A simple Rasberry Pi based robot project.

## Aims
- Improve my Python skills.
- Learn more about electronics and robotics.
- Have fun!


## Objectives
- Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping / Autonomy
  - Possibly using ocular SLAM with the single camera that will be added, or via additional sensors.
- Object recognition, location, and tracking
  - Recognise, find (e.g. explore a room until the object is located), and track objects.

## Completed
25.12.19 - Robot was assembled and initial motor control tests completed.
28.12.19 - Robot was re-assembled (with solder this time, my first solder job).
29.12.19 - Added a Bluetooth dongle and got remote controls working through an 8BitDo SF30 Pro Gamepad.
